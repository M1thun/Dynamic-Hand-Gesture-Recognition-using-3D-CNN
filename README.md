# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-3D-CNN
Project on recognising dynamic hand gesture from Chalearn Continuous gesture dataset for a total of 39 different gesture classes using 3D convolutional neural networks on Python3.

The repository contains the self-explanatory python3 code for starting from:
1. Fetching the data.
2. Dataset generation.
3. Dataset Pre-preprocessing.
4. Define the 3D CNN model.
5. Training the model.
6. Retraining the model.
7. Creating callbacks through tensorboard for graphical visualization.
7. Saving the model as tensorflow protobuf (.pb) file for future usage of mobile deployment.
8. Saving and loading as keras file(.h5).

Last but not the least..
9. * REAL-TIME visualization of results on Chalearn ConGD videos using OpenCV3.*
